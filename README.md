## Classification of Five Flower Categories (Rose, Daisy, Tulip, Dandelion, Sunflower) Using CNN
### Objective:
To classify images of flowers into five distinct classes using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with data preprocessing, augmentation, and model training techniques.
### Description:
The project involves classifying images into five flower categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). A dataset was organized into a zip folder, and paths to training and testing data were created. Data augmentation was applied to the training data using ImageDataGenerator to artificially expand the dataset by applying transformations like rotation, flipping, and scaling, enhancing model generalization. Additionally, images were rescaled to standardize pixel values between 0 and 1 to ensure compatibility with the CNN model. The CNN model was built with appropriate layers and compiled, and callbacks were defined to monitor training progress and prevent overfitting. The model was trained on augmented and preprocessed image data, achieving a training accuracy of 65%. This demonstrates the model's ability to learn patterns from image features for classification.
## Conclusion:
The CNN-based model successfully classified images into five flower categories with a training accuracy of 65%. Data augmentation and preprocessing significantly supported model learning, highlighting their importance in improving model performance and generalization.
